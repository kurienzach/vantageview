## Vantage View - 3D Walkthrough project (Purvanankara)

Vantage view aims to provide a unqiue experience by giving a virtual tour of the flats. Users can navigate around a Google Street View like interface. The project currently has two Apartment projects [The Tree](http://providenthousing.com/vantageview/thetree/) and [Kenworth](http://providenthousing.com/vantageview/kenworth/).

The backend for the project contains the necessary REST API's and the payment gateway interface written in Laravel. The frontend uses jQuery, raphael.js and three.js for rendering the 3d walkround views. Frontend code relies extensively on raphael.js to display the interactive flat selection screens.
